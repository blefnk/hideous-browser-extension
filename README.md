## Roadmap

TODO: Add `bun web-ext lint` to the `bun lint` script, and `bun web-ext run` to `bun dev`. Currently, an error is thrown: `Error: Cannot find module './url'`.

TODO: Try to remove `bun` and install `pnpm`. Check if `web-ext` works with this package manager, which works natively with `nodejs` (`bun` has its own libs).

TODO: `bun addons-linter ./extension/` doesn't work as well. This command throws an error: `You did not build addons-linter yet`. Maybe because of `bun`.

## Resources

- [web-ext](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext): A command line tool to help build, run, and test web extensions.

## Additional

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.12. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

## FAQ

_You can find other RQs (Reliverse Questions) in the [relivator-nextjs-template](https://github.com/blefnk/relivator-nextjs-template) repo._

- **RQ21:** How do I switch the package manager from `bun` to pnpm, yarn, or npm?
  **RA21:** Here's a variant of `scripts` for `pnpm`. Scripts presets for other package managers are coming soon. Just replace it in `package.json` (and make sure nothing is missing).

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "appts": "run-s knip format lint typestat typecheck build",
    "build": "pnpm build ./src/index.ts --outdir ./extension/",
    "debug:eslint": "pnpm cross-env TIMING=12 eslint --fix .",
    "dev": "pnpm run src/index.ts",
    "dev:ext": "pnpm web-ext run --source-dir ./extension/",
    "dev:firefox": "pnpm run dev:ext -- --firefox=nightly",
    "format": "pnpm biome format --write .",
    "knip": "dotenv knip",
    "latest": "pnpm update --latest && pnpm add -D typescript@rc typescript-eslint@rc-v8",
    "lint": "pnpm eslint --cache --fix . && pnpm biome lint --write .",
    "lint:al": "pnpm addons-linter ./extension/",
    "lint:we": "pnpm web-ext lint",
    "reli:help": "pnpm tsx reliverse.ts --help",

    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",

## What it does

The extension includes:

- a browser action with a popup including HTML, CSS, and JS
- a content script
- three images, each of a different beast, packaged as web accessible resources

When the user clicks the browser action button, the popup is shown, enabling
the user to choose one of three beasts.

When it is shown, the popup injects a content script into the current page.

When the user chooses a beast, the extension sends the content script a message containing
the name of the chosen beast.

When the content script receives this message, it replaces the current page
content with an image of the chosen beast.

When the user clicks the reset button, the page reloads, and reverts to its original form.

Note that:

- if the user reloads the tab, or switches tabs, while the popup is open, then the popup won't be able to beastify the page any more (because the content script was injected into the original tab).

- by default [`tabs.executeScript()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/tabs/executeScript) injects the script only when the web page and its resources have finished loading. This means that clicks in the popup will have no effect until the page has finished loading.

- it's not possible to inject content scripts into certain pages, including privileged browser pages like "about:debugging" and the [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/) website. If the user clicks the beastify icon when such a page is loaded into the active tab, the popup displays an error message.

## What it shows

- write a browser action with a popup
- how to have different browser_action images based upon the theme
- give the popup style and behavior using CSS and JS
- inject a content script programmatically using `tabs.executeScript()`
- send a message from the main extension to a content script
- use web accessible resources to enable web pages to load packaged content
- reload web pages
